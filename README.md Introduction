# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview
This project implements a **Network Intrusion Detection System** using **Suricata** on Ubuntu 24.04.  

It detects suspicious activity, generates alerts, and applies response mechanisms (logging attacker IPs).

## Features
- Suricata with custom rules
- Auto-response script to log attacker IPs
- Continuous monitoring of network traffic
- (Optional) visualization with EveBox in Docker

## Testing
1. Run Suricata:
   ```bash
   sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0 -D
